Ayman's Portfolio with Data Engineer Projects

Hello! My name is Ayman, and I am a highly motivated and passionate 3rd year Data Science Undergraduate Student at BINUS University. My journey in the world of data science has been both exciting and enriching, igniting an insatiable curiosity within me to explore the endless possibilities that data holds.

As a dedicated student, I have been actively involved in various academic and extracurricular activities. Currently, I am honored to serve as the General Treasurer at Himpunan Mahasiswa Teknik Informatika (HIMTI) BINUS, where I contribute my organizational and financial management skills to support the growth of the student community.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and programming languages like C, SQL, Python and R. I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills to tackle real-world challenges and make meaningful contributions to the field of data science.

If you are interested in discussing data-driven insights, problem-solving, or anything related to data science, feel free to reach out to me (aymanrafif00@gmail.com).
